# Luciél Technologies — AI Systems Portfolio
**By King Strahan**  
Technology that protects, breathes, and heals.

## About

I’m an AI Systems Developer and Implementation Specialist focused on building **human-centered AI systems** that ship, scale, and support real users—especially neurodivergent minds.

Across Custom GPTs and Base44 applications, I design and deploy AI systems centered on emotional intelligence, workflow automation, and practical implementation. This portfolio complements my professional background in implementation and customer onboarding by demonstrating how I design, ship, and iterate modern AI systems in real-world environments.
